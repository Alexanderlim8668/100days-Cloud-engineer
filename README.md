Starting My Cloud Journey — Why I'm Learning Networking First
Hi everyone! 👋 This is Week 1 of my #100DaysOfCloudEngineer journey, where I'm documenting my path from absolute beginner to cloud professional.

🌐 How Networks Connect the World Learned how communication works in a connected world using data, devices, and infrastructure.
🖧 Network Components & Types Explored routers, switches, hubs, end devices, and how LANs and WANs are used.
📶 Wireless & Mobile Networks Understood the basics of Wi-Fi, cellular networks, and how mobility affects communication.
🏠 Building a Home Network Learned how to plan and build a simple home network — devices, cables, and wireless setups.
⚙️ Communication Principles & Network Media Covered how data moves using electrical, light, and radio signals through different media like copper, fiber, and wireless.
🔌 The Access Layer Discovered how local devices connect through switches and access points.
🌍 IP Addressing (IPv4 & IPv6) Learned how IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are structured and used for routing and segmentation.
🧠 Dynamic IP Assignment with DHCP Saw how IP addresses are automatically assigned in networks using DHCP.
🔁 ARP & Gateways Understood how devices find each other using ARP and how gateways connect different networks.

Starting from scratch was a bit overwhelming at first, but Cisco's course made it easy to follow. The visual explanations and interactive quizzes helped a lot.
One tip I'd share with fellow beginners: Take notes in your own words.
